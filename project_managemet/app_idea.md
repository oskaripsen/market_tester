# 🧠 AI Persona Simulator

A platform that simulates realistic, data-driven user personas to test product ideas, UX flows, and messaging—enabling faster validation, feature prioritization, and iteration before involving real users.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Targeted Persona Testing**: Simulate feedback from realistic user segments (e.g. Gen Z students, SMB founders, sports parents).
- **Multi-Persona Simulation**: Run tests across several personas to compare reactions and preferences.
- **Product Idea Validation**: Test new concepts, positioning, pricing, and onboarding journeys.
- **Persona Builder**: Create or import personas using data from Reddit, reviews, interviews, etc.
- **Insight Dashboard**: View aggregated feedback, persona-level insights, and test comparisons.
- **Exportable Reports**: Generate shareable insights in PDF or public link format.

## 🏗️ V1 Architecture

### Backend (Python / FastAPI)

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Structure**:
  - `models/` – SQLAlchemy data models
  - `schemas/` – Pydantic request/response validation
  - `routers/` – API endpoints for simulations and persona management
  - `services/` – Business logic for persona simulation and prompt chaining
  - `core/` – Database connection, startup/shutdown logic
  - `middleware/` – Logging, error handling, API key auth
- **AI Layer**: OpenAI GPT-4o (via API) with engineered prompts
- **Queue**: BackgroundTasks or Celery for async simulation processing
- **Deployment**: Fly.io

### Frontend (Flutter)

- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Architecture**:
  - `models/` – Persona, test result, feedback objects
  - `services/` – Logic for persona simulation and result parsing
  - `repositories/` – API calls to FastAPI backend
  - `screens/` – Main UI views: Test Builder, Result Viewer, Dashboard
  - `widgets/` – Reusable components (persona cards, charts, inputs)
- **Features**:
  - Persona selection and test configuration form
  - Simulation results viewer with feedback grouped by persona
  - Dashboard with aggregated feedback and PDF export
- **Env Config**: Toggle between dev/prod APIs using `.env`
- **Dependencies**:
  - HTTP client
  - State management (e.g. Provider)
  - Local storage
  - Chart rendering
  - File export (PDF)
  - Auth & secure storage (optional in later versions)
